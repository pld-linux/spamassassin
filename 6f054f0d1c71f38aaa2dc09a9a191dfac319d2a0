- changed package names (daemon and tools, not perl-*) to lowercase for
  easy upgrade from RH: perl -pi -e 's/^(%[a-z]+ -n SpamAssassin)/lc $1/e'
- added obsoletes
- added Summary(pl), fixed %doc
- added %post and %preun scripts (chkconfig) for package spamassassin
  (I'm not sure about names inconsistency: init.d/spamassassin <-> spamd)
- moved %clean before %files, as in other perl specs
- release 2
